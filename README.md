# Non-Functional-Requirement-Conflict-Dataset
🧠 Non-Functional Requirement Conflict Dataset
This repository contains a curated dataset designed to identify and analyze conflicts in non-functional requirements (NFRs), with a focus on quality attributes. The dataset preparation follows a structured 8-step process, each captured in a separate sheet of the provided Excel file.

📁 Dataset Overview
The Excel file includes the following sheets:

Quality Attributes Identification

Main quality attributes, sub-attributes, individual attributes, and real-world examples collected from literature.

Initial Attribute Relationships

Pairwise relationships between main quality attributes based on findings from various research papers.

Unified Relationship Mapping

Redundancies are removed to form a single, comprehensive relationship map across all papers.

Numerical Representation of Relationships

Unified relationships are encoded using numerical values for modeling.

Sub-Attribute Relationships

Relationships between sub-quality attributes gathered from literature.

NFR Sentence Mapping

Sub-quality attributes are mapped to selected non-functional requirement sentences.

Cleaned Sentence Dataset

Only the selected sub-quality attributes and their corresponding sentences are retained.

Conflict Dataset Construction

Sentence pairs are labeled as conflicting or non-conflicting, and their relationships are numerically encoded for training machine learning models.
