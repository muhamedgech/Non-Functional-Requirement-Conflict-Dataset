# Non-Functional-Requirement-Conflict-Dataset
🧠 Non-Functional Requirement Conflict Dataset
This repository contains a curated dataset designed to identify and analyze conflicts in non-functional requirements (NFRs), with a focus on quality attributes. The dataset preparation follows a structured 8-step process, each captured in a separate sheet of the provided Excel file.

📁 Dataset Overview
The Excel file includes the following sheets:

Sheet 1: Quality Attributes Identification

        Main quality attributes, sub-attributes, individual attributes, and real-world examples collected from literature.

Sheet 3:Initial Attribute Relationships

        Pairwise relationships between main quality attributes based on findings from various research papers.

Sheet 3: Unified Relationship Mapping

        Redundancies are removed to form a single, comprehensive relationship map across all papers.

Sheet 4:Numerical Representation of Relationships

        Unified relationships are encoded using numerical values for modeling.

Sheet 5: Sub-Attribute Relationships

      Relationships between sub-quality attributes gathered from literature.

Sheet 6:NFR Sentence Mapping

      Sub-quality attributes are mapped to selected non-functional requirement sentences.

Sheet 7: Cleaned Sentence Dataset
    
      Only the selected sub-quality attributes and their corresponding sentences are retained.

Sheet 8:Conflict Dataset Construction

        Sentence pairs are labeled as conflicting or non-conflicting, and their relationships are numerically encoded for training machine     learning models.
